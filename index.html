    <h2>Italy</h2>
    <p>Italy is well-known for its architecture, culture, art, opera, literature, film, and fashion. This is one of the best countries to go on a foreign tour. The country is known for its mesmerizing topography, pristine beaches, historical artifacts, monuments, and more. Its capital, <strong>Rome</strong>, is home to the Vatican as well as landmark art and ancient ruins. Other major cities include Florence, with Renaissance masterpieces such as Michelangelo’s "David" and Brunelleschi's Duomo; <strong>Venice</strong>, the city of canals; and <strong>Milan</strong>, Italy’s fashion capital. I like to do activities like Glide through Venice in a Gondola, See an Opera in Verona's Roman Arena and Attend a Local Festival</p>
