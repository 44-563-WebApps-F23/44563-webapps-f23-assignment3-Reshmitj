    <h2>Pasta</h2>
    <p>Who doesn’t love pasta? It’s so delicious and offers so many practical advantages that it has become a favorite
        of both cooks and foodies and a staple of cuisines all around the world. Pasta is incredibly affordable, since
        it can be bought for cents on the dollar, but it’s also healthy. It contains very little salt, which is amazing
        for those with circulation problems, and you can also find gluten-free versions, so people allergic to gluten
        can enjoy it too. Probably there is no easier dish to cook than pasta. Boil water, add the pasta, drain it, add
        your favorite sauce</p>
